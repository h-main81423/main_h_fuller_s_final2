Needed resources: 
-Python
-CSS

## Looks of Website

*Hoping to make the website feel earthy and welcoming, not too overwhelming with the colours or graphics.*

**BE CONSISTENT**

*Blurbs to hold content*

*Better organization*

## Process Notes

*A little too large in container size, wish we used more of a thin container with more negative space*
*Colours make the site blend a bit too together in some areas*
